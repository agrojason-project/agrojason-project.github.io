# AgrojasonWebsite
www.agrojason.eu 


This is a website built for the Agrojason Project of the IEEE SB Volos.
I used HTML5, CSS/Boostrap along with some Javascript for the image slider, the progress bar, and to display the images when clicking on them.

The img folder contains the images used for the project.
The subfolders fromDraft and progress contain images used in the about and the sponsors page respectively.
There are htmls

index ->  the main page 

about us -> self explanatory

team -> page for the team members

sponsors -> Agrojason Projects sponsors

progress -> page that describes how the project started and the ways it has evolved

contact -> contact page

Hope you find the code useful!
